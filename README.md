# 👋 Hi, I'm Noah, I program things.... 

I'm a recent grad in **Otautahi CHCH NZ** 🌍, with a focus on **data science**, **large data handling**, **data processing**, and presenting information in intuitive ways for those of us who don't have time to muddle around in R Studio. ⏳

There's more in repos. I typically keep all course work unless it feels that it's an issue for faculty to have that floating around publically.
